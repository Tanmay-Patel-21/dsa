Problem statement
Given an array ‘ARR’ and an integer ‘K’, your task is to find all the count of all sub-arrays whose sum is divisible by the given integer ‘K’.

Note:
If there exists no subarray in the given sequence whose sum is divisible by ‘K’ then simply return ‘0’.
Example:
Suppose the given array is ‘ARR’ = { 5, 0, 2, 3, 1} and ‘K = 5’.
As we can see in below image, there are a total of 6 subarrays that have the total sum divisible by ‘K’
So we return the integer 6.
